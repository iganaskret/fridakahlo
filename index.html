        <h2>Frida Kahlo is diagnosed with polio</h2>
        <p>
          At age 6, Frida is struck with polio affecting the use of her right
          leg. Her leg grew very thin, and her foot was stunted in its growth.
          During her nine month convalescence, her father made sure that she
          regularly exercised the muscles in her leg and foot. Despite their
          efforts, her leg and foot remained deformed. Frida attempts to hide it
          by wearing pants, long skirts or two pairs of socks on her right foot.

        <h1>17 September 1925</h1>
        <h2>Frida Kahlo involved in a bus accident</h2>
        <p>
          Probably the most influential event in Frida's life was the most
          tragic one as well. When she was eighteen, she was in a bus accident
          that marred her for life. Her body was almost destroyed. Both her
          spinal column and pelvis were broken in three places. She was skewered
          by a metal handrail that entered her hip and exited through her
          vagina. The doctors did not expect her to live. It was during the time
          after this accident, while bed-ridden, that Frida began to paint.
